1727 "This translation is intended to supplement a work entitled “The"
1727 "Authoress of the Odyssey”, which I published in 1897. I could not give"
1727 "the whole “Odyssey” in that book without making it unwieldy, I"
1727 "therefore epitomised my translation, which was already completed and"
1727 "which I now publish in full."
1727 ""
1727 "I shall not here argue the two main points dealt with in the work just"
1727 "mentioned; I have nothing either to add to, or to withdraw from, what I"
1727 "have there written. The points in question are:"
1727 ""
1727 "(1) that the “Odyssey” was written entirely at, and drawn entirely"
1727 "from, the place now called Trapani on the West Coast of Sicily, alike"
1727 "as regards the Phaeacian and the Ithaca scenes; while the voyages of"
1727 "Ulysses, when once he is within easy reach of Sicily, solve themselves"
1727 "into a periplus of the island, practically from Trapani back to"
1727 "Trapani, via the Lipari islands, the Straits of Messina, and the island"
1727 "of Pantellaria."
1727 ""
1727 "(2) That the poem was entirely written by a very young woman, who lived"
1727 "at the place now called Trapani, and introduced herself into her work"
1727 "under the name of Nausicaa."
1727 ""
1727 "The main arguments on which I base the first of these somewhat"
1727 "startling contentions, have been prominently and repeatedly before the"
1727 "English and Italian public ever since they appeared (without rejoinder)"
1727 "in the “Athenaeum” for January 30 and February 20, 1892. Both"
1727 "contentions were urged (also without rejoinder) in the Johnian “Eagle”"
1727 "for the Lent and October terms of the same year. Nothing to which I"
1727 "should reply has reached me from any quarter, and knowing how anxiously"
1727 "I have endeavoured to learn the existence of any flaws in my argument,"
1727 "I begin to feel some confidence that, did such flaws exist, I should"
1727 "have heard, at any rate about some of them, before now. Without,"
1727 "therefore, for a moment pretending to think that scholars generally"
1727 "acquiesce in my conclusions, I shall act as thinking them little likely"
1727 "so to gainsay me as that it will be incumbent upon me to reply, and"
1727 "shall confine myself to translating the “Odyssey” for English readers,"
1727 "with such notes as I think will be found useful. Among these I would"
1727 "especially call attention to one on xxii. 465-473 which Lord Grimthorpe"
1727 "has kindly allowed me to make public."
1727 ""
1727 "I have repeated several of the illustrations used in “The Authoress of"
1727 "the Odyssey”, and have added two which I hope may bring the outer court"
1727 "of Ulysses’ house more vividly before the reader. I should like to"
1727 "explain that the presence of a man and a dog in one illustration is"
1727 "accidental, and was not observed by me till I developed the negative."
1727 "In an appendix I have also reprinted the paragraphs explanatory of the"
1727 "plan of Ulysses’ house, together with the plan itself. The reader is"
1727 "recommended to study this plan with some attention."
1727 ""
1727 "In the preface to my translation of the “Iliad” I have given my views"
1727 "as to the main principles by which a translator should be guided, and"
1727 "need not repeat them here, beyond pointing out that the initial liberty"
1727 "of translating poetry into prose involves the continual taking of more"
1727 "or less liberty throughout the translation; for much that is right in"
1727 "poetry is wrong in prose, and the exigencies of readable prose are the"
1727 "first things to be considered in a prose translation. That the reader,"
1727 "however, may see how far I have departed from strict construe, I will"
1727 "print here Messrs. Butcher and Lang’s translation of the sixty lines or"
1727 "so of the “Odyssey.” Their translation runs:"
1727 ""
1727 "Tell me, Muse, of that man, so ready at need, who wandered far and"
1727 "wide, after he had sacked the sacred citadel of Troy, and many were the"
1727 "men whose towns he saw and whose mind he learnt, yea, and many the woes"
1727 "he suffered in his heart on the deep, striving to win his own life and"
1727 "the return of his company. Nay, but even so he saved not his company,"
1727 "though he desired it sore. For through the blindness of their own"
1727 "hearts they perished, fools, who devoured the oxen of Helios Hyperion:"
1727 "but the god took from them their day of returning. Of these things,"
1727 "goddess, daughter of Zeus, whencesoever thou hast heard thereof,"
1727 "declare thou even unto us."
1727 ""
1727 "    Now all the rest, as many as fled from sheer destruction, were at"
1727 "    home, and had escaped both war and sea, but Odysseus only, craving"
1727 "    for his wife and for his homeward path, the lady nymph Calypso"
1727 "    held, that fair goddess, in her hollow caves, longing to have him"
1727 "    for her lord. But when now the year had come in the courses of the"
1727 "    seasons, wherein the gods had ordained that he should return home"
1727 "    to Ithaca, not even there was he quit of labours, not even among"
1727 "    his own; but all the gods had pity on him save Poseidon, who raged"
1727 "    continually against godlike Odysseus, till he came to his own"
1727 "    country. Howbeit Poseidon had now departed for the distant"
1727 "    Ethiopians, the Ethiopians that are sundered in twain, the"
1727 "    uttermost of men, abiding some where Hyperion sinks and some where"
1727 "    he rises. There he looked to receive his hecatomb of bulls and"
1727 "    rams, there he made merry sitting at the feast, but the other gods"
1727 "    were gathered in the halls of Olympian Zeus. Then among them the"
1727 "    father of men and gods began to speak, for he bethought him in his"
1727 "    heart of noble Aegisthus, whom the son of Agamemnon, far-famed"
1727 "    Orestes, slew. Thinking upon him he spake out among the Immortals:"
1727 "    ‘Lo you now, how vainly mortal men do blame the gods! For of us"
1727 "    they say comes evil, whereas they even of themselves, through the"
1727 "    blindness of their own hearts, have sorrows beyond that which is"
1727 "    ordained. Even as of late Aegisthus, beyond that which was"
1727 "    ordained, took to him the wedded wife of the son of Atreus, and"
1727 "    killed her lord on his return, and that with sheer doom before his"
1727 "    eyes, since we had warned him by the embassy of Hermes the"
1727 "    keen-sighted, the slayer of Argos, that he should neither kill the"
1727 "    man, nor woo his wife. For the son of Atreus shall be avenged at"
1727 "    the hand of Orestes, so soon as he shall come to man’s estate and"
1727 "    long for his own country. So spake Hermes, yet he prevailed not on"
1727 "    the heart of Aegisthus, for all his good will; but now hath he paid"
1727 "    one price for all.’"
1727 ""
1727 "    And the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him, saying: ‘O father,"
1727 "    our father Cronides, throned in the highest; that man assuredly"
1727 "    lies in a death that is his due; so perish likewise all who work"
1727 "    such deeds! But my heart is rent for wise Odysseus, the hapless"
1727 "    one, who far from his friends this long while suffereth affliction"
1727 "    in a sea-girt isle, where is the navel of the sea, a woodland isle,"
1727 "    and therein a goddess hath her habitation, the daughter of the"
1727 "    wizard Atlas, who knows the depths of every sea, and himself"
1727 "    upholds the tall pillars which keep earth and sky asunder. His"
1727 "    daughter it is that holds the hapless man in sorrow: and ever with"
1727 "    soft and guileful tales she is wooing him to forgetfulness of"
1727 "    Ithaca. But Odysseus yearning to see if it were but the smoke leap"
1727 "    upwards from his own land, hath a desire to die. As for thee, thine"
1727 "    heart regardeth it not at all, Olympian! What! Did not Odysseus by"
1727 "    the ships of the Argives make thee free offering of sacrifice in"
1727 "    the wide Trojan land? Wherefore wast thou then so wroth with him, O"
1727 "    Zeus?’"
1727 ""
1727 ""
1727 "The “Odyssey” (as every one knows) abounds in passages borrowed from"
1727 "the “Iliad”; I had wished to print these in a slightly different type,"
1727 "with marginal references to the “Iliad,” and had marked them to this"
1727 "end in my MS. I found, however, that the translation would be thus"
1727 "hopelessly scholasticised, and abandoned my intention. I would"
1727 "nevertheless urge on those who have the management of our University"
1727 "presses, that they would render a great service to students if they"
1727 "would publish a Greek text of the “Odyssey” with the Iliadic passages"
1727 "printed in a different type, and with marginal references. I have given"
1727 "the British Museum a copy of the “Odyssey” with the Iliadic passages"
1727 "underlined and referred to in MS.; I have also given an “Iliad” marked"
1727 "with all the Odyssean passages, and their references; but copies of"
1727 "both the “Iliad” and “Odyssey” so marked ought to be within easy reach"
1727 "of all students."
1727 ""
1727 "Any one who at the present day discusses the questions that have arisen"
1727 "round the “Iliad” since Wolf’s time, without keeping it well before his"
1727 "reader’s mind that the “Odyssey” was demonstrably written from one"
1727 "single neighbourhood, and hence (even though nothing else pointed to"
1727 "this conclusion) presumably by one person only—that it was written"
1727 "certainly before 750, and in all probability before 1000 B.C.—that the"
1727 "writer of this very early poem was demonstrably familiar with the"
1727 "“Iliad” as we now have it, borrowing as freely from those books whose"
1727 "genuineness has been most impugned, as from those which are admitted to"
1727 "be by Homer—any one who fails to keep these points before his readers,"
1727 "is hardly dealing equitably by them. Any one on the other hand, who"
1727 "will mark his “Iliad” and his “Odyssey” from the copies in the British"
1727 "Museum above referred to, and who will draw the only inference that"
1727 "common sense can draw from the presence of so many identical passages"
1727 "in both poems, will, I believe, find no difficulty in assigning their"
1727 "proper value to a large number of books here and on the Continent that"
1727 "at present enjoy considerable reputations. Furthermore, and this"
1727 "perhaps is an advantage better worth securing, he will find that many"
1727 "puzzles of the “Odyssey” cease to puzzle him on the discovery that they"
1727 "arise from over-saturation with the “Iliad.”"
1727 ""
1727 "Other difficulties will also disappear as soon as the development of"
1727 "the poem in the writer’s mind is understood. I have dealt with this at"
1727 "some length in pp. 251-261 of “The Authoress of the Odyssey”. Briefly,"
1727 "the “Odyssey” consists of two distinct poems: (1) The Return of"
1727 "Ulysses, which alone the Muse is asked to sing in the opening lines of"
1727 "the poem. This poem includes the Phaeacian episode, and the account of"
1727 "Ulysses’ adventures as told by himself in Books ix.-xii. It consists of"
1727 "lines 1-79 (roughly) of Book i., of line 28 of Book v., and thence"
1727 "without intermission to the middle of line 187 of Book xiii., at which"
1727 "point the original scheme was abandoned."
1727 ""
1727 "(2) The story of Penelope and the suitors, with the episode of"
1727 "Telemachus’ voyage to Pylos. This poem begins with line 80 (roughly) of"
1727 "Book i., is continued to the end of Book iv., and not resumed till"
1727 "Ulysses wakes in the middle of line 187, Book xiii., from whence it"
1727 "continues to the end of Book xxiv."
1727 ""
1727 "In “The Authoress of the Odyssey”, I wrote:"
1727 ""
1727 "the introduction of lines xi., 115-137 and of line ix., 535, with the"
1727 "writing a new council of the gods at the beginning of Book v., to take"
1727 "the place of the one that was removed to Book i., 1-79, were the only"
1727 "things that were done to give even a semblance of unity to the old"
1727 "scheme and the new, and to conceal the fact that the Muse, after being"
1727 "asked to sing of one subject, spend two-thirds of her time in singing a"
1727 "very different one, with a climax for which no-one has asked her. For"
1727 "roughly the Return occupies eight Books, and Penelope and the Suitors"
1727 "sixteen."
1727 ""
1727 ""
1727 "I believe this to be substantially correct."
1727 ""
1727 "Lastly, to deal with a very unimportant point, I observe that the"
1727 "Leipsic Teubner edition of 894 makes Books ii. and iii. end with a"
1727 "comma. Stops are things of such far more recent date than the"
1727 "“Odyssey,” that there does not seem much use in adhering to the text in"
1727 "so small a matter; still, from a spirit of mere conservatism, I have"
1727 "preferred to do so. Why [Greek] at the beginnings of Books ii. and"
1727 "viii., and [Greek], at the beginning of Book vii. should have initial"
1727 "capitals in an edition far too careful to admit a supposition of"
1727 "inadvertence, when [Greek] at the beginning of Books vi. and xiii., and"
1727 "[Greek] at the beginning of Book xvii. have no initial capitals, I"
1727 "cannot determine. No other Books of the “Odyssey” have initial capitals"
1727 "except the three mentioned unless the first word of the Book is a"
1727 "proper name."

1727 ""
1727 ""
1727 "Butler’s Translation of the “Odyssey” appeared originally in 1900, and"
1727 "The Authoress of the Odyssey in 1897. In the preface to the new edition"
1727 "of “The Authoress”, which is published simultaneously with this new"
1727 "edition of the Translation, I have given some account of the genesis of"
1727 "the two books."
1727 ""
1727 "The size of the original page has been reduced so as to make both books"
1727 "uniform with Butler’s other works; and, fortunately, it has been"
1727 "possible, by using a smaller type, to get the same number of words into"
1727 "each page, so that the references remain good, and, with the exception"
1727 "of a few minor alterations and rearrangements now to be enumerated so"
1727 "far as they affect the Translation, the new editions are faithful"
1727 "reprints of the original editions, with misprints and obvious errors"
1727 "corrected—no attempt having been made to edit them or to bring them up"
1727 "to date."
1727 ""
1727 "(a) The Index has been revised."
1727 ""
1727 "(b) Owing to the reduction in the size of the page it has been"
1727 "necessary to shorten some of the headlines, and here advantage has been"
1727 "taken of various corrections of and additions to the headlines and"
1727 "shoulder-notes made by Butler in his own copies of the two books."
1727 ""
1727 "(c) For the most part each of the illustrations now occupies a page,"
1727 "whereas in the original editions they generally appeared two on the"
1727 "page. It has been necessary to reduce the plan of the House of Ulysses."
1727 ""
1727 "On page 153 of “The Authoress” Butler says: “No great poet would"
1727 "compare his hero to a paunch full of blood and fat, cooking before the"
1727 "fire (xx, 24-28).” This passage is not given in the abridged Story of"
1727 "the “Odyssey” at the beginning of the book, but in the Translation it"
1727 "occurs in these words:"
1727 ""
1727 "“Thus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but he"
1727 "tossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front"
1727 "of a hot fire, doing it first on one side then on the other, that he"
1727 "may get it cooked as soon as possible; even so did he turn himself"
1727 "about from side to side, thinking all the time how, single-handed as he"
1727 "was, he should contrive to kill so large a body of men as the wicked"
1727 "suitors.”"
1727 ""
1727 "It looks as though in the interval between the publication of “The"
1727 "Authoress” (1897) and of the Translation (1900) Butler had changed his"
1727 "mind; for in the first case the comparison is between Ulysses and a"
1727 "paunch full, etc., and in the second it is between Ulysses and a man"
1727 "who turns a paunch full, etc. The second comparison is perhaps one"
1727 "which a great poet might make."
1727 ""
1727 "In seeing the works through the press I have had the invaluable"
1727 "assistance of Mr. A. T. Bartholomew of the University Library,"
1727 "Cambridge, and of Mr. Donald S. Robertson, Fellow of Trinity College,"
1727 "Cambridge. To both these friends I give my most cordial thanks for the"
1727 "care and skill exercised by them. Mr. Robertson has found time for the"
1727 "labour of checking and correcting all the quotations from and"
1727 "references to the “Iliad” and “Odyssey,” and I believe that it could"
1727 "not have been better performed. It was, I know, a pleasure for him; and"
1727 "it would have been a pleasure also for Butler if he could have known"
1727 "that his work was being shepherded by the son of his old friend, Mr. H."

1727 "Tell me, O Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide"
1727 "after he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit,"
1727 "and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was"
1727 "acquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his"
1727 "own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might he could"
1727 "not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in"

1727 "from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, oh"
1727 "daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you may know them."

1727 "So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely"

1727 "wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got him"
1727 "into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there"
1727 "came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca;"

1727 "and lie in two halves, the one looking West and the other East.1 He had"
1727 "gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying"
1727 "himself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house of"
1727 "Olympian Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that moment"

1727 "revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercury told him"
1727 "this in all good will but he would not listen, and now he has paid for"
1727 "everything in full.”"

1727 "Then Minerva said, “Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served"

1727 "far away, poor man, from all his friends. It is an island covered with"
1727 "forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a goddess lives there,"
1727 "daughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after the bottom of the"
1727 "ocean, and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth"
1727 "asunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses,"
1727 "and keeps trying by every kind of blandishment to make him forget his"
1727 "home, so that he is tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how he may"
1727 "once more see the smoke of his own chimneys. You, sir, take no heed of"
1727 "this, and yet when Ulysses was before Troy did he not propitiate you"
1727 "with many a burnt sacrifice? Why then should you keep on being so angry"
1727 "with him?”"
1727 ""
1727 "And Jove said, “My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget"
1727 "Ulysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor more"
1727 "liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear"
1727 "in mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses for having"
1727 "blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to"
1727 "Neptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter to the sea-king Phorcys;"

1727 "the waves aslant. By and by, as he swam on, he came to the mouth of a"

1727 "about—enough to make a covering for two or three men even in hard"
1727 "winter weather. He was glad enough to see this, so he laid himself down"

1727 "human voice, and told me to leave off crying. ‘Be of good courage,’ he"
1727 "said, ‘daughter of Icarius; this is no dream, but a vision of good omen"
1727 "that shall surely come to pass. The geese are the suitors, and I am no"
1727 "longer an eagle, but your own husband, who am come back to you, and who"
1727 "will bring these suitors to a disgraceful end.’ On this I woke, and"
